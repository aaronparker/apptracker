# App Tracker

An application version tracker that uses [Evergreen](https://eucpilots.com/evergreen-docs/) to query for application version updates and store the result in JSON format. A workflow runs every 24-hours to retrieve available updates and commit changes to this repository, which then generates the [App Tracker](http://stealthpuppy.com/apptracker/) site.
